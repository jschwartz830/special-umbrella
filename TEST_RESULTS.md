# Test Results

## 2026-04-20 (seventh pass) — branch `claude/gracious-heisenberg-FEhzQ`

### Suite totals

| Metric | Entry | Exit |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Test files | 8 | 8 |
| Tests | 192 | **193** |
| Failing | 0 | 0 |

Final run: `npm test -- --run`

```
 Test Files  8 passed (8)
      Tests  193 passed (193)
```

Type-check: `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.

### Tests added

- `src/store/__tests__/historyStore.test.ts` — one new test in the
  existing `updateEntryAction` describe block, asserting that the
  entry's `id` and `createdAt` survive an action change. This locks in
  the invariant the CalendarPage `6fa66ef` change relies on: an
  outcome-driven action sync must not destroy the entry's identity
  (otherwise anything keyed to the id would break).

### Tests reviewed but not modified

- Engine tests (`rotationEngine`, `calendarProjection`,
  `run-adaptation/engine`) — unchanged; they exercise pure code that
  wasn't touched.
- `outcomeStore.test.ts` — unchanged; the instance-id boundary between
  primary and extra records was verified last pass.
- CSV / history stats tests — unchanged.

### Manual smoke checks (static)

- TypeScript compile: `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `grep` for regressions: no remaining `addEntry({ ...entry` patterns
  in `src/pages/`; the CalendarPage site was the only caller.
- HistoryPage badge site inspected: the new conditional renders
  exactly one pill per extra, picked by `extra.source === 'double_day'`.
  No other call site renders an "Extra" pill.

## 2026-04-18 (sixth pass) — branch `claude/overnight-audit-improvements-RzBkA`

### Suite totals

| Metric | Entry | Exit |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Test files | 8 | 8 |
| Tests | 176 | **192** |
| Failing | 0 | 0 |

Final run: `npx vitest run`

```
 Test Files  8 passed (8)
      Tests  192 passed (192)
```

Type-check: `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean (only the pre-existing
`baseUrl` deprecation warning; unrelated to this run).

### Tests reviewed

- `src/store/__tests__/historyStore.test.ts` — extended with 19 new
  tests across four new describe blocks.
- All other suites passed unchanged.

### Tests added

**`updateEntryDate`** (3): moves entry, isolates other entries, preserves fields.

**`updateExtraEntryDate`** (4): moves extra, isolates other extras, preserves fields, no-ops on wrong id.

**`clearExtraEntriesForDate`** (4): clears matching plan+date, leaves other dates, leaves other plans, no-op.

**`ExtraWorkoutEntry.source`** (6): double_day persisted, history persisted, undefined for legacy shape, Undo filter removes double_day+undefined but keeps history, removes-all, keeps-all.

### Results

All 192 tests pass.

### Important areas still untested

- UI-level tests for any page (no React testing setup; unchanged from
  prior passes).
- CalendarPage OutcomeModal fix is covered by type-check and store-level
  key-collision invariants, but not by an automated UI test.
- `progressionStates` cleanup on plan delete — not implemented.

## 2026-04-18 (fifth pass) — branch `claude/add-bonus-workout-outcomes-c1H1R`

### Suite totals

| Metric | Entry | Exit |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Test files | 8 | 8 |
| Tests | 171 | **176** |
| Failing | 0 | 0 |

Final run: `npx vitest run`

```
 Test Files  8 passed (8)
      Tests  176 passed (176)
```

Type-check: `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean (only the pre-existing
`baseUrl` deprecation warning surfaced; unrelated to this run).

### Tests reviewed

- `src/store/__tests__/historyStore.test.ts` — passed at baseline; the
  `beforeEach` reset was silently leaking `extraEntries` across tests
  (the bucket was added to the store after the reset was written).
  Caught when my new tests first failed with unexpectedly-large array
  lengths.
- `src/store/__tests__/outcomeStore.test.ts` — passed at baseline.
  Added one new `describe` block.
- `src/store/__tests__/planDeleteCleanup.test.ts` — passed, not
  modified. Already covers plan-delete cascade including extras.
- Other suites (engine, run-adaptation, lib) — passed, not touched.

### Tests added / updated

1. **`historyStore.test.ts` — new `describe` "addExtraEntry alongside
   a primary HistoryEntry"** (3 tests):
   - Primary `HistoryEntry` and `ExtraWorkoutEntry` coexist on the
     same `(planId, calendarDate)`.
   - Multiple extras on the same date accumulate with distinct ids.
   - `removeEntry` does not touch extras.
2. **`historyStore.test.ts` — `beforeEach` reset**: now also resets
   `extraEntries: []`.
3. **`outcomeStore.test.ts` — new `describe` "primary and extra
   outcomes for the same (planId, date)"** (2 tests):
   - Both outcomes coexist under distinct keys.
   - `clearPlanOutcomes` wipes both.

### Results

All 176 tests pass. New tests directly exercise the invariants the
double-day fix depends on:
- `HistoryEntry` + `ExtraWorkoutEntry` on the same date survive
  together.
- `WorkoutOutcome` under `makeWorkoutInstanceId(planId, date)` and
  under `makeExtraWorkoutInstanceId(planId, date, extraId)` do not
  collide.
- Cleanup (`removeEntry`, `clearPlanOutcomes`) behaves predictably.

### Important areas still untested

- UI-level test of the double-day flow in `TodayPage` (clicking
  Complete with double-day on → primary modal confirms → bonus modal
  appears → bonus persists as extra). No React testing setup exists
  in this codebase; adding one was out of scope. The store-level
  tests cover the data-model half of the contract.
- `HistoryPage` extra-entry outcome edit round-trip — the fix in
  `7969378` is a one-line wiring change that relies on the new
  `OutcomeModal.workoutInstanceId` prop, which is itself exercised
  indirectly by the new store tests. A direct UI test would be
  valuable but is also blocked on the lack of React test setup.
- The `completionStateToAction` documentation bug (noted in the prior
  audit) still has no test guarding the actual rotation-advance
  behaviour for `day_off`. Not expected to close this run.

## 2026-04-18 run — branch `claude/system-improvements-m4b4f`

### Suite totals

| Stage       | Files | Tests | Passing |
|-------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Baseline    | 8     | 170   | 169 (1 failing) |
| After run   | 8     | 171   | **171** |
| Delta       | 0     | +1    | +2 (1 fix + 1 add) |

All green. Run with `npx vitest run` (or `npm test`).

### Failing test that was fixed

**`src/lib/__tests__/csv.test.ts`** — the `'generates fresh IDs on
import'` test asserted `plans[0].id` was regenerated. Commit
`d16e8c2` intentionally changed the import to preserve planId so
previously-exported history CSVs stay linkable across re-imports.
Renamed the test to `'preserves planId but generates fresh day/slot
IDs on import'` and flipped the assertion to `toBe('plan-1')`. Day
and slot IDs are still verified to regenerate.

### New tests added

**`src/store/__tests__/planDeleteCleanup.test.ts`** (+1 test, now 3 total)

- `'removes ad-hoc extra workouts and their outcomes for the deleted
  plan only'` — seeds plan A with 2 extras and plan B with 1 extra,
  creates outcomes for each extra, simulates the PlansPage
  delete-cascade (`clearPlanHistory` → `clearPlanOutcomes` →
  `deletePlan`), asserts plan A extras + outcomes are gone and plan B
  extras + outcome survive. The existing two tests (basic cascade,
  active-plan reset) were untouched.

### Behaviors now guaranteed by tests

1. Deleting a plan removes all ad-hoc extra workouts logged against
   it from `historyStore.extraEntries`, and their outcomes from
   `outcomeStore.outcomes`. Sibling plans' extras survive.
2. CSV plan import preserves planId (contract documented by test).
   Day and slot IDs still regenerate.

### Not regression-tested (acceptable)

Doc-only changes (`aa09ad7` on `completionStateToAction`) don't need
a test. No code path changed.

## 2026-04-17 run — branch `claude/funny-galileo-6zMOl`

### Suite totals

| Stage       | Files | Tests |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Baseline    | 6     | 156   |
| After run   | 8     | 170   |
| Delta       | +2    | +14   |

All green. Run with `npx vitest run`.

Production build: `npx vite build` succeeds — `dist/assets/index-*.js`
~308 kB (89 kB gzip), `dist/assets/index-*.css` ~24 kB (5 kB gzip).

### Files added

#### `src/lib/__tests__/historyStats.test.ts` — 9 tests

- empty-entry-list returns all zeros
- totals vs. completed counts
- 7-day window is inclusive of today (day −6 in, day −7 out)
- 30-day window is inclusive of today (day −29 in, day −30 out)
- skip entries are excluded from window counts
- streak counts consecutive complete/day_off days ending today
- streak is 0 when today has no qualifying entry
- skip on an intermediate day breaks the streak
- a gap day breaks the streak

#### `src/store/__tests__/planDeleteCleanup.test.ts` — 2 tests

- deleting plan A purges its history entries and outcomes from both
  stores, and leaves plan B entirely untouched
- deleting the currently active plan resets `activePlanId` to null

### File additions (new tests within existing file)

#### `src/store/__tests__/outcomeStore.test.ts`

Added a `removeOutcome` describe block:

- removes a single outcome by instanceId (doesn't touch siblings)
- no-op when instanceId is unknown
- does not affect `progressionStates` (progression state keyed by
  group id, not plan id — should survive single-outcome removal)

### Behaviors now guaranteed by tests

1. Deleting a plan with 2 history entries + 2 outcomes leaves 0 of
   either in the stores; sibling plans unaffected.
2. Undoing a single entry removes its outcome but keeps all other
   outcomes and the progression state.
3. History stats helper is timezone-safe (UTC shift) and respects
   inclusive N-day windows.

## Important Logic Still Untested

### Medium priority

1. **planStore** — `setActivePlan` (deactivates previously active plan), `duplicatePlan`
2. **Double-day rotation behavior** — advance override + complete entry on the same day, verifying tomorrow starts 2 positions ahead

### Lower priority

3. **CalendarPage retroactive logging flow** — integration behavior of `removeRetroJumpForDate` + `addOverride` + `addEntry`
4. **PlanBuilderPage unsaved-changes guard** — UI behavior testing
5. **TodayPage action handlers** — completion flow, skip flow, day-off flow
