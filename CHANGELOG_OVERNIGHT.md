# Overnight Changelog

## 2026-05-30 (forty-fourth pass) — branch `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-uCF1X`

Baseline on entry: **766 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **767 passing, 0 failing** (+1 test).

### Change 1 — fix: `moveByWorkoutInstance` propagates `calendarDate`

**Summary:** When a workout entry is moved to a different calendar date, `exerciseHistoryStore.moveByWorkoutInstance` now updates `calendarDate` on every affected `ExerciseSessionRecord` in addition to `workoutInstanceId`. Previously only the instance key was updated, leaving `calendarDate` pointing to the original date.

**Why it matters:** `calendarDate` is the sort key for `getByExerciseName` and the date field for `computePersonalRecords` (`maxLoadDate`, `maxRepsDate`). A stale date caused PR achievements to be attributed to the wrong day and disrupted chronological ordering in exercise history views.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/exerciseHistoryStore.ts` — parse new instanceId to extract `calendarDate`; update both fields together
- `src/store/__tests__/exerciseHistoryStore.test.ts` — new test: `'updates calendarDate to the date embedded in the new instanceId'`

**Risks/tradeoffs:** None. The fix is purely additive: the previous implementation always left `calendarDate` unchanged; the new one updates it when the instanceId contains a valid date. All existing tests still pass.

**Rollback:** `git revert b5a87b9`

### Change 2 — perf+ux: memoize `planExtras` and show session date in TodayPage

**Summary:** Two improvements to `TodayPage.tsx`:

1. **`planExtras` memoization** — Moved `planExtras` from an inline `filter()` (run on every render) into a `useMemo` keyed on `extraEntries` and `activePlanId`. The inline version created a new array reference on every TodayPage re-render, defeating `WeeklyActivityStrip`'s own `useMemo` and causing unnecessary recomputation of the 7-day strip.

2. **"X days ago" on last-session hint** — When the previous session summary is shown (e.g. "Last: 3×8 @ 135 lb Bench Press · PB"), the display now appends "· yesterday" or "· Xd ago" based on the calendarDate embedded in the previous session's `workoutInstanceId`. Uses no external imports beyond what was already present; no changes to `sessionSummary.ts`.

**Why it matters:** (1) Fewer re-renders on the most-visited page, especially noticeable when the app has many extra entries. (2) Users recovering from a gap (injury, travel) or planning a PR attempt can immediately judge how fresh their reference session is, without navigating to History.

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx` — `useMemo` for `planExtras`; session date derivation; JSX update for date hint

**Risks/tradeoffs:** The `planExtras` memo is placed before the early `!plan` guard; it returns `[]` when the plan is null, which is correct behavior. The date display only shows when `prevSessionDaysAgo > 0`; it is invisible if the previous session was today (which cannot happen given the `currentDate` exclusion in `findPreviousSessionForPlanDay`). No user-visible regression risk.

**Rollback:** `git revert 52a7ead`

## 2026-05-29 (forty-third pass) — branch `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-4tAQK`

Baseline on entry: **758 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **766 passing, 0 failing** (+8 tests).

### Change 1 — test: sync progression tests with progressionMode guard and volume mode fix

**Summary:**

PR #121 merged since pass 42 added two intentional behavior changes to
`buildWeightsRecommendation` in `progression.ts`:

1. A new guard at line 101 returns `null` when no exercise has `progressionMode` set.
   This was intentional: the commit message states "Exercises with no progressionType/progress
   rule produce no indicator."
2. Volume mode now uses `allSetsHitTarget` (same logic as single/double modes), so
   completing all sets to their target reps now returns `progress` instead of always `hold`.

Six tests were written against the old behavior and were failing as a result. Fixes:

- Added `progressionMode: 'single'` to exercises in four single-mode tests (progress/hold/
  hold-undefined/regress) that had no `progressionMode` and were hitting the new null guard.
- Split the volume mode "always returns hold" test into two: `progress` (all sets hit target,
  the correct behavior) and `hold` (sets below target). The old description was wrong.
- Added `progressionMode: 'single'` to the legacy `weightlifting` type test.
- Added a new null-path test: "returns null when no exercise has progressionMode configured"
  — documents the new guard behavior and prevents regression if the guard is ever loosened.

**Files changed:**
- `src/modules/workout-outcomes/__tests__/progression.test.ts` (+52 lines, 6 fixed, 1 split into 2, 1 new)

**Risk:** Zero — test-only change. No production code modified.

---

### Change 2 — fix: migrate pre-existing extras with undefined source to 'history'

**Summary:**

`ExtraWorkoutEntry` gained a `source` field to distinguish user-added extras ('history')
from double-day bonus extras ('double_day'). TodayPage's Undo handler removes extras where
`source !== 'history'`. Pre-existing extras created before this field was introduced have
`source === undefined`, which Undo treats as `'double_day'` — silently deleting manually-added
extras on Undo. This was documented as a known risk across passes 38–42.

Fix: added `version: 1` and a `migrate` function to `historyStore`'s persist config. The
migration runs once on first load for all users (v0 → v1) and sets `source: 'history'` on
any extra with `source === undefined`. Extras with explicit source values are unchanged.

The migration function is extracted as a named export (`migrateHistoryState`) for direct
unit testing.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/historyStore.ts` — added `version: 1`, `migrateHistoryState` exported function
- `src/store/__tests__/historyStore.test.ts` — 6 new tests (undefined→history, preserved
  double_day, preserved history, skip at v1+, empty array, missing field)

**Risk:** Very low. The migration is idempotent and only touches `extraEntries`. Adding
`version: 1` causes Zustand to re-run the migration on first load — safe because the
storage key (`wpt_history`) is unchanged and the migration handles all data shapes.

**Rollback:** Remove `version` and `migrate` from the persist config. Users who already
ran the migration will keep `source: 'history'` on their old extras (no revert on their
data); the Undo behavior will remain correct (extras stay 'history' on Undo).

---

## 2026-05-28 (forty-second pass) — branch `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-HtWcw`

Baseline on entry: **748 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **758 passing, 0 failing** (+10 tests).

### Change 1 — fix: clear active set timer on deleteSet, fix working set numbering, improve progression preview

**Summary:**

Three issues in `ActiveWorkoutTracker`:

1. **Stale active set timer after `deleteSet`**: When a set was deleted while it was the
   active timer (or when a higher-indexed set was deleted, shifting indices), `activeSetRef`
   and `activeSetTimer` were not cleared. The per-second interval would update a stale or
   wrong-position set. Added a guard that clears the active set timer whenever the deleted
   set's `setIdx ≥ activeSetRef.current.setIdx` for the same exercise.

2. **Working set numbers included warmup indices**: Sets were numbered with their raw
   `setIdx + 1`, so a 2-warmup + 3-working-set exercise showed "3", "4", "5" for working
   sets instead of "1", "2", "3". Fixed by computing the position among working sets only.

3. **Opaque progression preview labels**: "weights[1]: +5lb" replaced with "Set 1: 135 → 140 lb".
   When all working sets share the same transition, collapsed to a single "All sets: X → Y lb"
   line. No load data falls back to "Set N: +Xlb".

**Files changed:**
- `src/components/workout/ActiveWorkoutTracker.tsx`

**Risk:** Zero on data path. All three are display/correctness fixes with no state mutation changes.

---

### Change 2 — test: add direct isoWeekStart test cases

**Summary:** `isoWeekStart` was only exercised indirectly through `computeWeeklyBreakdown`.
Added 6 direct tests covering Monday (identity), Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday (end of ISO week),
month-boundary crossing (Feb 1 → Jan 26), and year-boundary crossing (Jan 1 → Dec 29 prior year).

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/__tests__/historyStats.test.ts` (+6 tests, import updated)

**Risk:** None — test-only change.

---

### Change 3 — fix: exclude future-dated entries from longestStreak

**Summary:** `computeHistoryStats` built the `streakable` set from all entries without
filtering to `<= today`. CSV imports with future dates would inflate `longestStreak`.
Added a filter before the consecutive-run walk. Added a regression test with a 3-day past
run and a future entry on day 4 — verifies `longestStreak = 3`, not 4.

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/historyStats.ts` (one-line filter added)
- `src/lib/__tests__/historyStats.test.ts` (+1 test)

**Risk:** Low. Only affects users who have future-dated entries (unusual scenario, typically
from bad imports). Those users would see `longestStreak` decrease to the correct value.

---

### Change 4 — fix: avoid name accumulation in duplicatePlan

**Summary:** Successive duplication produced "Name (copy) (copy) (copy)". Now strips any
trailing " (copy)" or " (copy N)" suffix from the source name before appending, then uses
a numeric counter (" (copy 2)", " (copy 3)", …) when the simple "(copy)" name is already
taken by an existing plan.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/planStore.ts`
- `src/store/__tests__/planStore.test.ts` (+3 tests)

**Risk:** Low. Users with "(copy)" plans will see different copy names on next duplication.
The behavior is strictly more useful and non-destructive.

---

## 2026-05-27 (forty-first pass) — branch `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-9NxZ6`

Baseline on entry: **748 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **748 passing, 0 failing** (+0 tests; no new test files needed — fixes covered by existing tests and no new logic added).

---

### Change 1 — feat: add ErrorBoundary to prevent blank-screen crashes

**Summary:** Any uncaught render or hook error in React 18 unmounts the full
component tree and leaves the screen blank with no recovery path. Added a
`ErrorBoundary` class component in `src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
that wraps the entire `<Routes>` tree in `App.tsx`. On error it renders a
minimal "Something went wrong" recovery screen with the error message and a
"Try again" button (calls `setState({ error: null })` to attempt a re-render).

**Files changed:**
- `src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (new file)
- `src/App.tsx` (wraps `<Routes>` in `<ErrorBoundary>`)

**Risk:** Zero on happy path. Recovery UI replaces blank screen on error.

---

### Change 2 — fix: guard empty date in HistoryPage edit modal

**Summary:** `saveAndClose` in `HistoryPage` did not validate that
`editingEntryDate` was non-empty before proceeding. If the user cleared the
date input field and clicked Save, `updateEntryDate(id, '')` was called,
corrupting the entry's `calendarDate` to `''`. Subsequent renders or key
lookups using that field would silently fail. Added `if (!newDate) { setDateConflict(true); return }` before the conflict check. Applied the same
guard to `saveAndCloseExtra`. Updated the inline error message to distinguish
"Date is required." from "A workout is already logged for that date."

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/HistoryPage.tsx`

**Risk:** Near-zero. Only adds an early-exit guard for an input state that was
previously silently handled incorrectly. No behavior change for valid dates.

---

## 2026-05-26 (fortieth pass) — branch `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-8Sa0s`

Baseline on entry: **743 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **748 passing, 0 failing** (+5 tests).

---

### Change 1 — fix: guard setActivePlan against non-existent plan ID

**Summary:** `planStore.setActivePlan(id)` previously had no early-return guard for
the case where `id` is not present in `state.plans`. The function would iterate all
existing plans and deactivate them, then write `updated[id] = { ...updated[id], ... }`
where `updated[id]` was `undefined` — spreading undefined is a no-op in JS, so the
result was a plan record with only the explicitly-assigned fields (`status`, `startDate`,
`startDayIndex`, `updatedAt`) and no required plan properties. `activePlanId` would also
be set to the invalid ID, pointing to a malformed entry on every render.

**Fix:** Added `if (!(id in s.plans)) return s` before the deactivation loop.

**Why it matters:** Any UI component calling `setActivePlan` with an unvalidated ID
(e.g., after a plan was deleted from a different tab/window) would silently corrupt the
store. The guard makes the behavior deterministic and safe.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/planStore.ts` — added guard
- `src/store/__tests__/planStore.test.ts` — added test `'is a no-op when the plan id does not exist'`

**Risks / tradeoffs:** None. Guard is only hit for IDs not in the store — a condition
that should never arise in normal use, so no observable change for valid calls.

---

### Change 2 — test: null perceivedEffort coverage for swim buildProgressionRecommendation

**Summary:** The run slot already had a test verifying that `perceivedEffort: null`
defaults to 3 (the progress threshold) and returns `action: 'progress'`. The swim branch
uses the identical `(outcome.perceivedEffort ?? 3) <= 3` expression but had no dedicated
test. Added one test for the swim case.

**Files changed:**
- `src/modules/workout-outcomes/__tests__/progression.test.ts` — +1 test

**Risks / tradeoffs:** Test-only. No production code change.

---

### Change 3 — feat: include swim actuals in history CSV export and import

**Summary:** `historyToCsv` only exported run actuals. Swim workout data
(`actualDistanceMeters`, `actualDurationMin`, `averagePaceSecondsPer100m`,
`completedAsPlanned`) was silently dropped — users who export CSV for backup or migration
lose all swim workout performance data.

**Fix:** Added four new columns to `HISTORY_HEADERS` (`swimActualDistanceMeters`,
`swimActualDurationMin`, `swimAveragePaceSecondsPer100m`, `swimCompletedAsPlanned`).
Both the rotation and extra row builders now populate these columns from
`outcome.swimActual`. The `buildOutcomeFromRow` importer reconstructs `swimActual` when
any swim column is present. Columns are appended after the existing run columns so all
prior CSV exports remain valid (missing columns parse as undefined → `swimActual` unset).

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/csv.ts` — HISTORY_HEADERS, rotation row, extra row, buildOutcomeFromRow
- `src/lib/__tests__/csv.test.ts` — +3 tests: rotation round-trip, extra round-trip, empty columns

**Risks / tradeoffs:** The four new columns extend every CSV export going forward. Old
exports are fully backward compatible. `completedAsPlanned` now has two representations
(`completedAsPlanned` for run, `swimCompletedAsPlanned` for swim) — this is intentional
to avoid ambiguity when a row contains both.

**Rollback:** `git revert` the commit. CSVs exported before the revert would re-import
correctly (no swim columns → `swimActual` undefined). CSVs exported after this feature
and before a revert would lose swim data on re-import, but no data is corrupted in the store.

## 2026-05-25 (thirty-ninth pass) — branch `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-0z9MJ`

Baseline on entry: **738 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **743 passing, 0 failing** (+5 tests).

### Change 1 — fix: nanoid import path in csv.ts and PlanBuilderPage.tsx

**Summary:** Both `src/lib/csv.ts` and `src/pages/PlanBuilderPage.tsx` imported `nanoid`
from `'../engine/rotationEngine'` (or `'../../engine/rotationEngine'`). rotationEngine.ts
re-exports `nanoid` from `lib/utils` — the re-export works, but couples these utilities to
the rotation engine's public surface. The same issue was fixed in `exerciseHistoryStore.ts`
in pass 37, but these two files were missed.

**Why it matters:** Import coupling at this level is low-risk but creates a confusing
dependency graph: changing rotationEngine's exports could silently break CSV parsing and
plan editing. Importing from the canonical source removes the indirection.

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/csv.ts` — `from '../engine/rotationEngine'` → `from './utils'`
- `src/pages/PlanBuilderPage.tsx` — `from '../engine/rotationEngine'` → `from '../lib/utils'`

**Risks / tradeoffs:** No behavior change. Both imports resolve to the same function.

**Rollback:** `git revert` the commit — no state affected, purely an import change.

---

### Change 2 — fix + feat: buildLastSessionSummary avoids ×undefined; shows +N more

**Summary (fix):** `buildLastSessionSummary` in `sessionSummary.ts` used
`s.actualReps != null ? s.actualReps : s.targetReps` to determine the rep count to display.
When `actualReps` is null and `targetReps` is `undefined` (no target was set), this passed
`undefined` directly into the template string — producing "Last: 2×undefined @ 135 lb Squat".
Fixed by using nullish coalescing: `s.actualReps ?? s.targetReps ?? null`. When the result
is null, the format falls back to "N sets" (e.g. "Last: 2 sets @ 135 lb Squat").

**Summary (feature):** For workouts with multiple exercises that have actual logged data,
appends "(+N more)" to the session hint. For example, a 3-exercise session now shows
"Last: 1×5 @ 185 lb Squat (+2 more)" instead of only the first exercise. Only exercises
with at least one non-null reps or load value are counted, so placeholder/unlogged exercises
don't inflate the count. Single-exercise workouts are unchanged.

**Why it matters (fix):** The bug affects any set where load was recorded but reps were not —
a real pattern for timed holds, isometric exercises, or when a user logs weight only. The
corrupted output "×undefined" is immediately visible and confusing.

**Why it matters (feature):** TodayPage's pending workout hint now reflects the scope of the
last session at a glance. Users with 4–6 lift programs see more useful context for planning
their next session weight selections.

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/sessionSummary.ts` — reps assignment + repsStr + moreStr (7 lines)
- `src/lib/__tests__/sessionSummary.test.ts` — 5 new tests

**Risks / tradeoffs:** The bug fix changes the display format for the undefined case from
"×undefined" to " sets". This is strictly better UX. The multi-exercise feature appends text
to an existing string — single-exercise output is bit-for-bit identical to before.

**Rollback:** `git revert` the commit — pure display-layer change, no store or schema impact.

---

## 2026-05-24 (thirty-eighth pass) — branch `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-oaS1e`

Baseline on entry: **734 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **738 passing, 0 failing** (+4 tests).

---

### Change 1 — fix: deferred outcomes no longer fire YAML progression rules

**Summary:** `logOutcomeWithProgression` in `outcomeStore.ts` now excludes
`deferred` from the `session_complete` context variable alongside `skipped` and
`planned`. Previously, deferring a workout (which the history engine maps to a
`day_off` action — no workout performed) would still evaluate progression rules
that check `if: session_complete`, causing variable increments (e.g., `load += 5`)
to fire without any actual workout being completed.

**Why it matters:** YAML-imported plans use progression rules such as
`if: session_complete then load += 2.5` to auto-advance per-exercise load across
sessions. If a `deferred` outcome fires those rules, the user's program variables
drift forward without any work being done — the next session would start with a
higher target weight than warranted. This is a silent data corruption bug with no
runtime error or user-visible warning.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/outcomeStore.ts` — one-line fix adding `!== 'deferred'` guard
- `src/store/__tests__/outcomeStore.test.ts` — 3 new tests (deferred, completed, skipped)

**Risks / tradeoffs:** The only behavior change is that deferred outcomes no longer
advance YAML progression variables. Users who have already had deferred outcomes
fire their progression rules will not see a rollback of those variables (persisted
state is not retroactively corrected — that would require a migration). New defer
events after this commit are correctly excluded.

**Rollback:** Remove `outcome.completionState !== 'deferred'` from the `session_complete`
expression in `logOutcomeWithProgression`.

---

### Change 2 — fix: deep-clone DrillSpec[] within RunSegment.drills on plan duplication

**Summary:** `deepCloneWorkoutSlot` in `planStore.ts` now maps `s.drills` within
each run segment so that drill objects are independent between the original and
the duplicated plan. Previously `segments.map(s => ({ ...s }))` shallow-cloned
each segment, leaving the `drills` array (and its `DrillSpec` objects) shared.

**Why it matters:** Pass 37's REVIEW_NOTES explicitly called this out as a remaining
recommendation. The same category of bug was fixed for `SetSpec[]` in pass 37 (for
`exercises`/`warmup`) and for top-level `exercises`/`warmup`/`segments` arrays in
pass 34. `RunSegment.drills` was the last remaining shallow-clone gap in the
`duplicatePlan` path. Editing drill names, reps, or sets in one plan after duplication
would silently mutate the other plan's drill specs.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/planStore.ts` — 4 lines changed in `deepCloneWorkoutSlot` segment mapper
- `src/store/__tests__/planStore.test.ts` — 1 new test for DrillSpec[] isolation

**Risks / tradeoffs:** The only behavior change is that `duplicatePlan` for plans with
run segments containing drills now does an extra `map` over `s.drills`. Drill arrays are
small (typically 2–8 entries) so the performance impact is negligible. Plans without run
drills are unaffected by the `s.drills ?` guard.

**Rollback:** Revert the segment mapper in `deepCloneWorkoutSlot` back to
`segments: slot.segments.map(s => ({ ...s }))`.

---

### Change 3 — fix: nanoid import path in exerciseHistoryStore

**Summary:** `exerciseHistoryStore.ts` imported `nanoid` from
`../engine/rotationEngine` (which re-exports it). Changed to import directly
from `../lib/utils` where `nanoid` is defined.

**Why it matters:** The transitive import creates an unnecessary dependency between
`exerciseHistoryStore` and the rotation engine. If `rotationEngine.ts` ever stops
re-exporting `nanoid` (e.g., during a future refactor), `exerciseHistoryStore` would
silently break. The direct import is self-documenting and correct.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/exerciseHistoryStore.ts` — 1 import line changed

**Risks / tradeoffs:** Zero behavior change. Same function, same module — different
import path.

**Rollback:** Revert the single import line.

---

### Change 4 — feat: surface progressionRecommendation.note in TodayPage pending hint

**Summary:** The previous-session hint block on TodayPage now shows a `↗ [note]`
line when the prior session's outcome carries a `progressionRecommendation.note`
(e.g., "add 2.5 lb next session"). This is shown only for non-run slots — run slots
already have `todayAdaptationNote` from the run progression state machine and
showing both would be redundant. Only visible when the today card is pending
(`prevSessionOutcome` is computed only when `isPending`).

**Why it matters:** `progressionRecommendation.note` was being computed and stored
in outcomes (by `buildProgressionRecommendation` in the weights progression module)
but never surfaced at decision time. Users who had logged a session that generated a
progression recommendation had to open the outcome modal to see it. Surfacing it
inline at the moment the user is about to start their workout closes the loop —
the guidance appears exactly when it's actionable.

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx` — 4 lines added: conditional in the `&&` guard, new `<p>` element

**Risks / tradeoffs:** Purely additive. `prevSessionOutcome` is already computed and
`progressionRecommendation` is an optional field — if absent, the guard short-circuits.
No new store subscriptions, no new computation, no risk to users without outcomes.
The `!todayRunSlot` guard ensures run days are unaffected.

**Rollback:** Remove the `!todayRunSlot && prevSessionOutcome?.progressionRecommendation?.note`
condition from the outer `&&` and remove the `<p>` element inside the hint block.

Baseline on entry: **732 passing, 0 failing**. Exit state: **734 passing, 0 failing** (+2 tests).

### Change 1 — fix: deep-clone SetSpec[] within exercises and warmup on plan duplication

**Summary:** `deepCloneWorkoutSlot` in `planStore.ts` now deep-clones the `sets`
field within each `ExerciseSpec` when it is an array of `SetSpec` objects. Previously,
duplicating a plan produced exercise specs that shared the same `SetSpec` array objects
between the original and the copy, meaning a future edit to one plan's set data would
silently corrupt the other.

**Why it matters:** Pass 34 fixed the top-level `exercises` / `warmup` / `segments`
array references, but missed one nesting level: each `ExerciseSpec.sets` when it is
a `SetSpec[]` (structured sets from YAML import). The bug would manifest if a user
duplicated a YAML-imported plan and then edited per-set details (rep count, load,
rest time) in one plan — the other plan's sets would change too without any user action.
This is a silent data corruption risk with no runtime error.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/planStore.ts` — added `deepCloneExerciseSpec` helper (10 lines); updated
  `deepCloneWorkoutSlot` to use it for both `exercises` and `warmup`
- `src/store/__tests__/planStore.test.ts` — 2 new tests for SetSpec[] isolation

**Risks / tradeoffs:** The only change to production behavior is that `duplicatePlan`
for plans with structured exercises will do one additional `map` over the sets array.
This is negligible (sets arrays are small). Existing plans without structured exercises
(i.e., manually-built plans or YAML imports where `sets` is a plain number) are
unaffected — the `Array.isArray(ex.sets)` guard is a no-op for non-array sets.

**Rollback:** Revert `planStore.ts` to the prior `slot.exercises.map(e => ({ ...e }))` form.

---

### Change 2 — fix: WeeklyActivityStrip uses newest entry when duplicates exist for a date

**Summary:** The 7-day activity strip used `Array.find()` to look up a history entry
for each day, which returns the first matching element regardless of recency. All other
parts of the engine (rotation pointer computation, today's status resolution) use the
newest `createdAt` when multiple entries exist for the same date. The strip is now
consistent with that behavior. Also wires `computePlanStreak` into the streak stat so
the semantic is explicit.

**Why it matters:** With the existing `find()`, if a date had two entries (e.g., one
created via CSV import and a newer one from the UI), the strip might color that dot
based on the stale imported entry rather than the most-recent user action. In practice
this is rare (deduplication runs on addEntry and importEntries), but the inconsistency
was a latent correctness gap. `computePlanStreak` was a recommendation from pass 25 and
is now used in the streak stat for clearer code intent.

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx` — 10 lines changed (4 for dedup fix, 6 for planStreak wiring)

**Risks / tradeoffs:** The `planStreak` value is semantically equivalent to the former
`stats.currentStreak` when `planEntries` is pre-filtered (as it is today), so displayed
numbers are unchanged. The dedup fix only affects users who have duplicate entries for the
same date, which is an edge case.

**Rollback:** Revert the `filter + reduce` block back to `find()` and restore
`stats.currentStreak`.

---

### Change 3 — fix: block saving a plan with duration value < 1 in Plan Builder

**Summary:** Both Save buttons in PlanBuilderPage are now disabled when `durationValue < 1`,
and an inline error message explains the constraint. The `handleSave` function also returns
early for this case. A red border on the duration input field signals the problem visually.

**Why it matters:** A `duration.value` of 0 causes `isPlanExpired()` to return `true`
immediately on the start date (weeks-type) or as soon as any entry exists
(rotations-type, since `Math.floor(0 / days.length) >= 0` is always true). This creates
a plan that appears fully complete before the user logs any workouts, showing a "Plan
complete!" banner immediately after activation. The UI input's `|| 1` guard already
prevents 0 from being set through the numeric field, but the YAML editor path
(`applyYamlChanges → setDurationValue`) bypasses it. This fix closes the gap at the
save boundary.

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/PlanBuilderPage.tsx` — 7 lines changed

**Risks / tradeoffs:** Low risk. The guard only blocks save; it doesn't auto-correct the
value, preserving user awareness. The visual feedback (red border + error text) makes
the problem actionable. Users who set a valid value via YAML then later see this warning
know exactly what to fix.

**Rollback:** Remove the `durationValue < 1` checks from `handleSave` and the two `disabled`
expressions. Remove the red-border conditional and the error `<p>` element.

### Change 1 — fix: importOutcomes syncs exercise history with plan/workout context

**Summary:** `outcomeStore.importOutcomes` now calls `syncExerciseHistory` for each
incoming outcome rather than calling `upsertFromOutcome` directly. This gives imported
exercise records the same `planName` and `workoutName` metadata that live-logged records carry.

**Why it matters:** After CSV import, the exercise history store receives weight data
but no plan or workout context (both fields are `null`). This affects how exercise records
appear in the history page stats and any future per-plan filtering. The live logging
path already resolved this context correctly — import was the only gap.

**Files changed:**
- `src/store/outcomeStore.ts` — one-line fix in `importOutcomes`
- `src/store/__tests__/outcomeStore.test.ts` — 6 new tests

**Risks / tradeoffs:** `syncExerciseHistory` looks up plan and workout name from the
current store state. If the plan has been deleted since the outcome was originally
created, `planName` will be `null` — same as today's behavior. No behavior change
for non-weights outcomes (no-op since the function returns early if there's no
`weightsActual.exercises`).

**Rollback:** Revert the single-line change back to `exStore.upsertFromOutcome(o)`.

### Change 2 — feat: confirm before bulk-marking unlogged days as Day Off

**Summary:** Added a confirmation modal before the "Mark N as Day Off" bulk action
in TodayPage. The modal lists the dates that will be affected and requires explicit
confirmation before calling `markDaysAsOff`.

**Why it matters:** Without a confirmation step, a single accidental tap on a mobile
screen could silently batch-mark up to 7 past days, affecting the rotation pointer
for all of them. The modal is non-destructive to add (it's purely gating an existing
action) and easy to dismiss.

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx` — ~30 lines added

**Rollback:** Remove `showCatchupConfirm` state and the `Modal` block; revert the
"Mark N as Day Off" button onClick to call `markDaysAsOff(plan.id, unloggedDates)` directly.
