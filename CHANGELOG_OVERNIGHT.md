### Commit 1

**test: cover additionalDates parameter in getStreakDatesSet and computePlanStreak (12 tests)**

#### What changed

- **Modified** `src/lib/__tests__/historyStats.test.ts`: Added 12 new tests covering the `additionalDates?: Set<string>` parameter of `getStreakDatesSet` and `computePlanStreak`.

#### Why

The `additionalDates` parameter was introduced to allow mobility-session dates (from `mobilityCompletions`) to count toward the plan streak displayed on `TodayPage`. `TodayPage.tsx` line 338 actively uses:

```typescript
computePlanStreak(plan.id, planEntries, planExtras, today, mobilityDateSet)
```

Despite this production usage, neither `getStreakDatesSet` nor `computePlanStreak` had any test that passed a non-empty `additionalDates` argument. The 7 `additionalDates` tests added to `computePlanStreak` cover: today-only date, consecutive dates, bridging a rotation gap, not bridging without the date, unconditional application (not filtered by planId), empty-set parity, and future dates not extending the streak. The 5 `additionalDates` tests in `getStreakDatesSet` cover: single date, multiple dates, union with entries, unconditional (not planId-filtered), and empty-set parity.

#### Risk

None — pure test additions. No production code was modified. All 1068 tests pass.

# Overnight Changelog — Pass 75 (2026-07-09)

### Commit 1 — `090e73e`

**perf+fix: pre-compute PR flags map in HistoryPage; add max-date to history date pickers**

#### Part A — O(N log N) PR flags pre-computation

- **New export** `buildPRFlagsMap(allRecords)` added to `src/lib/historyStats.ts`: Processes all `ExerciseSessionRecord` entries in a single pass sorted by `calendarDate`. Groups records by date so same-date sessions all see the same prior max (identical semantics to `computeWorkoutPRFlags`). Returns `Map<workoutInstanceId, {hasLoadPR, hasRepsPR}>` in O(N log N) overall vs. O(N²) when calling `computeWorkoutPRFlags` per history item.
- **Modified** `src/pages/HistoryPage.tsx`: Imports `buildPRFlagsMap` instead of `computeWorkoutPRFlags`. Adds `const prFlagsMap = useMemo(() => buildPRFlagsMap(allExerciseRecords), [allExerciseRecords])`. Both `OutcomeMetrics` call sites in the rendered list now do `prFlagsMap.get(instanceId)` (O(1)) instead of scanning all records inline.
- **New tests** in `src/lib/__tests__/historyStats.test.ts`: 7 tests covering empty input, first-session PR, load PR on exceed, no PR on tie, same-calendarDate records see same prior max, produces identical results to `computeWorkoutPRFlags` across three sessions, zero/null load exclusion.

#### Part B — History date picker future-date guard

- **Modified** `src/pages/HistoryPage.tsx` lines 768 and 863: Added `max={today}` to both `<input type="date">` elements in the history edit modals (rotation entry date and extra entry date). Prevents accidentally moving a logged workout to a future date. `today` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) is already available from `useToday()` at the top of the component.
- **Why**: Without `max`, both the browser date-picker UI and manual text entry allowed future dates. The `saveAndClose` and `saveAndCloseExtra` handlers had no server-side validation against future dates either.
- **Risk**: None — `today` is a stable value (changes only at midnight via `useToday`), and `max` is a standard HTML attribute that degrades gracefully on unsupported browsers (no constraint applied).

### Commit 2 — `e701e20`

**fix: remove unused withDurationMin helper in estimateRunDuration test (TS6133)**

- **Modified** `src/lib/__tests__/estimateRunDuration.test.ts`: Removed `withDurationMin` helper function (lines 5–7) that was declared but never called. This was the sole `tsc --noEmit` error at pass start (TS6133: 'withDurationMin' is declared but its value is never read).
- **Why**: The helper was likely a leftover from an earlier test draft. The `withTargetDurationMin` and `withTargetDistanceMiles` helpers that are actually used remain unchanged.
- **Risk**: None — removing unused dead code.

# Overnight Changelog — Pass 74 (2026-07-08)

## Branch: `claude/dreamy-mccarthy-ugdev5`

### Commit 1 — `bd8907d`

**refactor: extract estimateRunDurationMin to lib + add 22 unit tests**

- **New file** `src/lib/estimateRunDuration.ts`: Pure utility function extracted from `TodayPage.tsx` module scope. Estimates planned run duration in minutes from slot metadata using the following resolution order: `slot.durationMin` → `runConfig.targetDurationMin` → sum of segment durations → sum of segment distances × pace-by-type → `runConfig.targetDistanceMiles × 11` → 20 (default). Pace constants: tempo = 8 min/mi, warmup/cooldown = 12 min/mi, all other types = 11 min/mi.
- **New file** `src/lib/__tests__/estimateRunDuration.test.ts`: 22 tests covering every resolution branch, segment duration unit parsing (`"30min"`, `"20m"`, decimal values), segment distance with pace-by-type, `programVars` substitution (numeric and string var values), unknown variable skipping, `targetDistanceMiles` fallback, and all edge cases (empty slot, null runConfig, empty segments).
- **Modified** `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx`: Removed the inline 35-line `estimateRunDurationMin` definition; added `import { estimateRunDurationMin } from '../lib/estimateRunDuration'`. The function already accepted `programVars` as a second parameter since it was extracted to module scope in pass 72 — no call-site changes needed. Also added `differenceInCalendarDays` to the date-fns import (used in commit 2).
- **Why**: The function was untestable in isolation while living in a component file. Extracting it enables the 22 new tests and makes the logic independently reviewable.
- **Risk**: None. Function body is identical; only file location changed.

### Commit 2 — `047f8a1`

**refactor: replace manual date arithmetic in prevSessionDaysAgo with differenceInCalendarDays**

- **Modified** `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx`: Replaced an 8-line IIFE that used raw `Date.UTC(y, m, d)` subtraction to compute `prevSessionDaysAgo` with a single expression using `differenceInCalendarDays(parseISO(today), parseISO(prevSessionDate))` from date-fns.
- **Why**: The manual arithmetic was correct but verbose, hard to scan, and inconsistent with the rest of the codebase which uses date-fns throughout. The new expression is semantically equivalent: it computes the calendar-day difference (not wall-clock millisecond difference) between `today` and `prevSessionDate`, then returns `null` if the result is ≤ 0 (e.g., same-day session).
- **Risk**: Low. `differenceInCalendarDays` is already used extensively in the project. The guard `d => d > 0 ? d : null` preserves the same null-return behavior for same-day or future dates.

### Commit 3 — `1a29a3a`

**perf: memoize rotationLoggedCount Set creation in TodayPage**

- **Modified** `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx`: Wrapped `rotationLoggedCount` (a `Set<string>` built from `planEntries.map(e => e.calendarDate)`) in `useMemo` with `[planEntries]` as the dependency.
- **Why**: The Set was being rebuilt on every render (including every modal state transition, every scroll, and every unrelated state update). The computation is O(n) and was re-running for non-data changes. Memoizing it means the Set is only rebuilt when `planEntries` actually changes.
- **Risk**: None. The memoized value is semantically identical; the only change is when it recomputes.

---

### Commit 4 — `c337fa3`

**feat: Show "Cycle done" visual cue when rotation cycle just completed**

- **Modified** `src/pages/TodayPage.tsx`: Added a "Cycle done" chip that appears in the cycle progress section when `justCompletedRotation === true` (returned by `computeRotationCycleProgress`). Previously, completing the last workout in a cycle would show "0/N cycle" which was confusing — it looked like no progress rather than 100% progress.
- **Why**: The existing `justCompletedRotation` boolean was computed but the UI had no display path for it. The new chip ("Cycle done ✓") replaces the "0/N" text when the cycle is complete.
- **Risk**: Low — purely additive JSX conditional. `justCompletedRotation` is only `true` when `doneInCycle === 0 && totalDone > 0`, which is already well-tested.
